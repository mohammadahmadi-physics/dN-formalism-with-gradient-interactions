This repository contains the Python codes used in the analysis presented in the accompanying paper arXiv:2602.00902. The scripts implement the numerical calculations discussed in the text and are intended to reproduce the main results of the work.

The code evaluates the power spectrum of curvature perturbations using the higher-order matching method and the δN formalism, and compares the results with the exact Mukhanov–Sasaki solution. It also evaluates the equilateral non-Gaussianity parameter using the δN formalism.
