This repository contains the Python codes used in the analysis presented in the
accompanying paper. The scripts implement the numerical calculations discussed in the text and are
intended to reproduce the main results of the work.

Description
The code evaluates the power spectrum of curvature perturbations using the
higher-order matching method and the δN formalism, and compares the results with
the exact Mukhanov–Sasaki solution. It also evaluates the equilateral
non-Gaussianity parameter using the δN formalism.
